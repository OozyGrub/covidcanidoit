        COVID-19, aka coronavirus, is a new virus that the public health and
        medical community is
        <b style="color: #fd6167">still learning about.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Our team reviewed
        <b style="color: #fd6167">public comments</b>
        made by infectious disease experts and, when available,
        <b style="color: #fd6167">published scientific literature</b>
        , to assess the
        <b style="color: #fd6167">potential risk of getting and spreading</b>
        COVID-19 posed by doing common, everyday things.

        Two independent
        <b style="color: #fd6167">reviewers</b>
        rated the overall risk of each activity and for seven specific age
        groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        These ratings were

        <b style="color: #fd6167">changing research</b>
        on COVID-19.
