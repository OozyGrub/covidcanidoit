                CovidCanIDoIt uses Google Maps data which tracks
                location-specific popularity and wait times to estimate whether
                a place is busy and let you know that it might be too busy to
                go.

                Research has shown that having one or more specific
                diseases/conditions can increase your risk of developing severe
                illness. CovidCanIDoit summarizes recommendations from health
                authorities when you share your disease/medical condition
                information with us.
              </p>

              <p>
                The tool will also suggest that you take additional precautions,
                like avoiding more crowded places, and finding lower risk ways
                of accomplishing your daily tasks.

          we cannot ensure the security of all information you provide to us via

            type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors
            are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We
            may associate your device identifier or website usage information
            with the personal information you provide, but we will treat the
            combined information as personal information.
