      COVID-19, aka coronavirus, is a new virus that the public health and
      medical community is still learning about. Our team reviewed public
      comments made by infectious disease experts and, when available, published
      scientific literature, to assess the potential risk of getting and
      spreading COVID-19 posed by doing common, everyday things. Two independent
      reviewers rated the overall risk of each activity and for specific seven
      age groups. These ratings were independently reviewed by a panel of
      experts and revised based on their comments and feedback. These ratings
      reflect what we know about risk associated with doing any activity and are
      reviewed each week to reflect changing research on COVID-19.

          The tool uses Google Maps data which tracks location-specific
          popularity and wait times to estimate whether a place is busy and let
          you know that it might be too busy to go.

          Research has shown that having one or more specific
          diseases/conditions can increase your risk of developing severe
          illness. The tool summarizes recommendations from health authorities
          when you share your disease/medical condition information with us.
